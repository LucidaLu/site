I am a master's candidate at Laboratory for Quantum Computation and Theoretical Computer Science, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiaoming Sun and Prof. Guojing Tian. I received my B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2022.

My research has been focused on quantum computation, specifically, quantum circuit optimization and variational quantum algorithms. I also have a strong interest in algorithmic graph theory.

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in fall 2025.
